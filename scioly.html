    <p1>
        I've been a competitor for the Acton-Boxborough Science Olympiad team for the past four years now, competing in all types of tournaments from regionals to Nationals and visiting campuses from nearby MIT to Colorado State University.

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p1>
    For me, SciOly served as a gateway into the entire world of STEM. I'd like to give back as much as possible, both as a senior captain to my team and hopefully as an event supervisor during my undergraduate years. Below you'll find my a Drive folder of my current inventory of tests, which will be updated as I write more.
